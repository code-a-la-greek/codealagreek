          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            HTML code is responsible for making the website itself, but a
            website with just html code is a plain, black and white page. In
            order to add color, fonts or in general to control how your site
            looks like, you need to use the CSS language. <br />
            This simple guide to CSS language will take you through the basic
            concepts so you can modify the style of your website by yourself. If
            you want to check on your html code, you can always review
            <br />
            <a href="http://panugr.github.io/flipbook-HTML">My guide to HTML basics</a>.

          <p class="w3-panel">
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <br />
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen.
            <br />
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web
            pages all at once.

            Back in the old days, you could add style right in the html code.
            You can just add <b>style</b> property and into that you can add the
            style you want. <br />
            For example the code
            <code>&lt;p style= "color: red;"&gt;</code> will make the text in
            your paragraph red. <br /><br />
            You can already imagine the problem that this method creates. You
            have a messy styling code inside your html code and when you want a
            change you have to change manually all those style properties.
            <br />
            To solve this problem, CSS language was created. CSS removed the
            style formatting from the HTML page and it's normally saved in
            external
            <b>.css files</b>. With an external stylesheet file, you can change
            the look of an entire website by changing just one file! <br />
            Then this external .css file is linked with your .html file.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            To link your .css file to the .html file you need to add a
            <b>link</b> tag into the <b>head</b> tag of your html code: <br />
            <code
              >&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="<em
                >local address to your .css file</em
              >"></code
            >

            src="site-without-style.jpg"
            alt="A webpage without link to css file"
          />

            CSS has its own syntax, but it's quite simple and straightforward.
            <br />
            A CSS rule-set consists of a <b>selector</b> and a
            <b>declaration block:</b> <br />
            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. It can be
            any html tag you want to style, h1, p, img and so on. <br />
            The declaration block is surrounded by curly braces <b>{}</b> and it
            contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons
            <b>(;)</b>. Each declaration includes a CSS <b>name</b> and a
            <b>value</b>, separated by a <b>colon (:)</b>.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            For Example, If we wanted the color of our text to be green, we
            would do it like this: <br />
            <code>p{color:green;}</code> We can add as many declarations we want
            as long we separate them with semicolons. <br />
            <code
              >p{color:green; font-size: 32px; background-color: grey;}</code
            >

          <h2>Selectors</h2>
          <p>
            CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you
            want to style and we can divide them into five categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The CSS element Selector</li>
            <li>The CSS id Selector</li>
            <li>The CSS class Selector</li>
            <li>The CSS Universal Selector</li>
            <li>The CSS Grouping Selector</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The CSS element Selector</h3>
          <p>
            The element selector selects HTML elements based on their tagname.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            Here, all &lt;p&gt; elements on the page will be with a red text
            color: <br />
            <code>p{color:red;}</code>
          </p>
          <p class="pageNum">-7-</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The CSS id Selector</h3>
          <p>
            The id selector uses the <b>id attribute</b> of an HTML element to
            select a specific element. The id selector is used to select
            <b>one unique element!</b> To select an element with a specific id,
            write a hash (#) character,<br />
            followed by the id of the element. Because the id attribute has to
            be unique, it's recommended to avoid it. You can use
            <em>classes</em> instead.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            The CSS rule below will be applied only to the HTML element with the
            id="para1": <br />
            <code>#para1{font-size:32px}</code>
          </p>
          <h3>The CSS class Selector</h3>
          <p>
            The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class
            attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period
            (.) character, followed by the class name.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            In this example all HTML elements with the class="red" will be red:
            <br />
            <code>.red{color:red;}</code>
          </p>
          <p class="pageNum">-8-</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The CSS Universal Selector</h3>
          <p>
            The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
            It's recommended to use it for style that are definitely applied to
            all of your elements, such as margin, fonts etc.
          </p>
          <!--  <p class="w3-panel">
            The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page:
            <br />
            <code>*{margin:0;}</code>
          </p> -->
          <h3>The CSS Grouping Selector</h3>
          <p>
            The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same
            style definitions. Instead of writing the same code multiple times,
            it's better to group the selectors to minimize the code. <br />
            To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            In this example we have grouped together couple of selectors which
            would take the same style: <br />
            <code>p,h1{text-align:center;}</code>
          </p>

          <h2>Typography and Visual Rules</h2>
          <h3 id="fonts">Fonts</h3>
          <h4>font-family</h4>
          <p>
            The browsers use a default font to show your text but with CSS is
            possible to change that font. Remember however three important
            things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The font in use must be installed on the user's computer.
              Computers have many fonts pre-installed but it's a good idea to
              use couple of fonts just in case. Especially if your main font is
              not so common.
            </li>
            <li>
              The default font is <em>Times New Roman</em> and if you don't
              change it, you don't have to mention it on your css file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fonts belong in two main font-categories, the
              <em>Serif font</em> and the <em>Sans-Serif font.</em> The Serif
              font has calligraphic letters, while the Sans-Serif is more clean
              and modern
            </li>
            <li class="smallPage">
              When the name of our font is more than one word, then it's good to
              have the name in quotes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <article class="smallPage">
            <h4>font-size</h4>
            <p>
              You can change the size as you like.By default the size of the
              letters is 16px and headings are a bit bigger.
            </p>
          </article>
          <p class="pageNum">-10-</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>font-weight</h4>
          <p>
            Instead of inserting the
            <code>&lt;b&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;</code> tag all the time in your
            html document, you can use <code>font-weight:bold;</code> to make an
            element or many elements to appear bolder. <br />
            However you can and should still use the <code>strong</code> tag if
            there is strong meaning in your sentence, since it is a semantic
            tag.
          </p>
          <h4>font-style</h4>
          <p>
            Similar to <code>font-weight and &lt;b&gt;</code>tag, you can use
            <code>font-style:italic;</code> instead of <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>,
            to make an element appear in italic style.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            <code
              >p{font-family: georgia, arial,serif; font-size: 20px; } <br />
              h2{font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;}
            </code>

        <section>
          <h3>Text</h3>
          <h4>text-align</h4>
          <p>
            You can control how your text will be aligned. The default value is
            <code>left</code>. It can also be <code>right</code> and
            <code>center</code>.
          </p>
          <h4>text-transform</h4>
          <p>
            You can use the value <code>capitalize</code> to capitalize the
            first letter of each word, <code>uppercase</code>,
            <code>lowercase</code> to make every letter capital or small letter.
          </p>
          <h4>word-spacing</h4>
          <p>
            It's not so common but sometimes you might want to give an extra
            space between the words. You can set your own distance in
            px(=pixels).
          </p>
          <h4>letter-spacing</h4>
          <p>
            Similar to <code>word-spacing</code> you can increase the space
            between the letters.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            <code
              >p{text-align:center;} <br />
              h1{text-transform:uppercase;}

          <h3>Colors</h3>
          <p>
            In css colors can be specified by using a color name like red, blue,
            yellow and so on. We can also set a color to the background, using
            the <code>background-color.</code><br />
            In CSS, colors can also be specified using:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>RGB values: rgb(255, 99, 71)</li>
            <li>HEX values: #ff6347</li>
            <li>HSL values: hsl(9, 100%, 64%)</li>
            <li>RGBA values: rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)</li>
            <li>HSLA values: hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These values give us more control over the contrast, hue, opacity
            values of our colors.
          </p>
          <h4>opacity</h4>
          <p>
            Opacity controls the transparency and it accepts a number from 0-1.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            <code
              >body{background-color: light-gey;} <br />

          <h3>Borders</h3>
          <p>
            Every html element is surrounded by a border, which is invisible by
            default. With the <code>border</code> property, you can change the
            style of it. <br />
            The <code>border</code> takes 3 values: border's width, style and
            color.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The width determines how thick/thin is the border. You can set it
              with pixels (px) or you can use the pre-defined values:
              <code>thin, medium, thick.</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Style determines the border's style. There are pre-defined values
              such as: <code>solid, double, dashed, dotted.</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The color determines the border's color and it can be any color.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is possible to make a border to look like a circle with the
            <code>border-radius</code> property. You can use px or % and the
            higher the value the more rounded it gets.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            <code>button{border:1px solid red; border-radius:100%;}</code> That
            will make the button a perfect circle.

          <h2>The Box Model</h2>
          <p>
            As we have already learned, each element takes its own space on the
            page and the content resides inside that space, that <em>box</em>.
            <br />
            There are 4 properties that can manipulate the space that an element
            will take on the page and also the space that the content will take
            inside its own box. <br />
            We've already examined the <code>border</code>, which changes the
            border surrounding the element. The rest are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>width and height</code>: manipulate the dimensions of the
              content itself
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>padding</code>: manipulates the amount of space between the
              content and the border
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>margin</code>: manipulates the amount of space between the
              border and the rest of the webpage
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 style="margin: 0">width and height</h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 0px">
            There are default settings by all the browsers but we can change
            them. If we set a size in pixels, it will be the same across all
            devices. This method is not so flexible with big sizes <br />
            because maybe our content looks fine in a laptop, but it will
            overflow a mobile screen. Another method is to set a size in
            percentage %. Then the element will keep the same amount of
            screen-space across all devices.

          <h3>padding and margin</h3>
          <p>
            <code>padding</code> can take 4 values:
            <code
              >padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left</code
            >
            controlling each side of the element. However if you want to change
            all sides <br />
            you can set all 4 values together by typing just
            <code>padding</code>. In this case, the sizes you type work
            clockwise, meaning the values are: top-left-bottom-right. <br />
            If all the values are the same size, then it's enough if you declare
            just one size. If the values are same in pairs, like some top-bottom
            and same left-right, then it's enough to declare 2 sizes.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-panel">
            <code>h1{padding-bottom:20px;}</code>: This will add 20 pixels space
            only on the top of the content. <br />
            <code>h1{padding:20px;}</code>: This will add 20 pixels space around
            the content. <br />
            <code>h1{padding:20px 30px;}</code>: This will add 20pixels space on
            the top and bottom of the content and 30 pixels space around the
            left and right of the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>margin</code> has the same syntax with <code>padding</code>.
          </p>
          <!--  <p class="w3-panel">
            <code>img{margin:50px 30px 20px 10px}</code>: This will add space
            between the image element and the rest of the webpage.

          <h2>Flexbox</h2>
          <p>
            Flexbox is an easy, yet powerful method to display multiple elements
            in a flexible, responsive way. To start you need to declare
            <code>display:flex</code> on a <em>parent</em> element. <br />
            Flex automatically will place the <em>children</em> elements on a
            row. Then you have a lot of control over the way it's displayed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>flex-direction:column</code> sets your elements to be
              displayed in a column.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>flex-wrap</code> take 2 values, either wrap or nowrap and it
              controls whether your elements will change the row, if they don't
              fit on the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>align-items</code> positions your elements
              <b>vertically</b> inside the flexbox. This property is declared on
              the <em>parent</em> container and its value can be:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>start</code>: elements are positioned to the top of the
                container
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>end</code>: elements are positioned to the bottom of the
                container
              </li>
              <li><code>center</code></li>

          <h2>What's Next?</h2>
          <p>
            Congratulations! you started styling your website, all by yourself!

          <p>
            Now that you know the basics of CSS you can enrich your styling by
            using css-libraries and frameworks. There are tons of them out on
            the internet but i can give you some hints. <br />
            In <em>Google Fonts</em> you can find many fonts that you can import
            to your website. If you want to add icons in your website, instead
            of importing images, you can add icons from
            <em>font-awesome</em> site. <br />
            They are free and easy to use. You just copy the code in your html
            and that's it. Then you can style in your css file. There are
            frameworks like bootstrap, skeleton and others that can a lot of
            styling and you won't have to write that much of code by yourself.
          </p>

            working in automobile industry. On April 2020, I had the opportunity
            to join Codecademy and start a Web-Development course. I learnt
            Html, Css and Javascript among other side-subjects. I love Frond-End
            Development, I am very passionate about it and I spend all my free
            time in building projects and learning from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this book, "simple guide to CSS", I try to give clear and simple
            code instructions for beginners on how to style a webpage by using
