      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Hello. My name is Panagiotis Panagiotakopoulos and I'm currently working in the automobile industry.
        In April 2020, I joined Codecademy and started studying Web-Development. I enjoy the frontend development. I
        like to build websites and web-applications.

    <section id="about" class="py-4 container flexbox">
      <p> I've also joined Frontend Mentor, a
        site where
        I can complete frontend challenges.
        All the projects in my portfolio are either based on exercises
        during my studies in Codecademy or completed challenges from
        Frontend Mentor.

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Up until today, my experience in coding comes from working on
        projects, from Codecademy and Front-end mentor. I have also worked on
        other people's projects, which has given me valuable experience. You
        can read more about these projects below.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Elisan Antologia</summary>
        <p>
          <em>Elisan Antologia</em> is a blog for Elisa Stenberg, a young
          writer from Finland. She needed a blog to share her writings. Since
          the project wasn't that demanding, I suggested creating a one-page
          site styled with W3.CSS to display her documents. <br /><br />
          On second thought, however, I made two separate pages since one page
          would have been too long to read if all of her documents were on the
          same page. <br /><br />
          I worked a lot with handlebars.js in this project and I loved it. I
          used handlebars to display each of her documents on a second
          webpage. How to display each article on a different page using their
          id, was something that I hadn't tried before so, I am quite excited
          about doing it.
          <br /><br />
          The site displays many photos. There are background photos on the
          body and for each article. Handling manually the photos became
          quickly hard so, I started to use the ImageKit CDN for an easier
          image transformation and conversion. <br /><br />
          I learned more about handlebars and the use of an image-CDN. The
          site is light, loads fast and the Lighthouse results are good.
          Overall, I am satisfied with the result.

        <summary>Revelation Football Club</summary>
        <p>
          This has been another interesting project, which is still in
          progress. <br />
          <br />
          A football club located in Ghana wanted a site to present
          themselves. Building the site, I had to take into account the lack
          of infrastructure or/and the slow internet connection in Ghana. The
          site needs to load and run fast. I use the W3.CSS framework, which
          is very light and, I will try to use as native Javascript as
          possible. <br />
          One concern is that I use pictures in a webp format. Safari browser
          doesn't have good support and, since I don't know which Safari
          version the users will be using, I might have a problem with that
          but, it's an easy fix.<br />
          <br />
          This is the first time that I am not working alone on a project. The
          client has an opinion about the state of the site and on the other
          side, I get pictures and guidelines from a designer, who works with
          them. <br />
          On this project, I had the chance to use a wireframe to show a basic
          structure for the site. I had read about it during my studies on
          Frond-End Development but I had never tried it before. I didn't use
          some computer program, I just made a pdf document.
          <br />
          This situation has taught me a lot about communication. <br />
          Overall, I am happy with the process and the progress of the site.
