        <p>I am currently working in the automobile industry and in April 2020, I had the opportunity to join Codecademy
          and start a
          Web-Development course. I love Frond-End Development and I
          spend all my free time building projects and learning from that
          process.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>Up until today, my experience in coding comes from working on my projects. However, I recently started working
        on other people's projects, which has given me valuable experience. You can read more about these projects
        below.</p>
      <details class="w3-padding-top-24 details">
        <summary>Elisan Antologia</summary>
        <p class="w3-left-align"><em>Elisan Antologia</em> is a blog for Elisa Stenberg, a young writer from Finland.
          She needed a blog to
          share her writings. Since the project wasn't that demanding, I suggested creating a one-page site styled with
          W3.CSS to display her documents. <br><br>
          On second thought, however, I made two separate pages since one page would have been too long to read if all
          of her documents were on the same page. <br><br>
          I worked a lot with handlebars.js in this project and I loved it. I used handlebars to display each of her
          documents
          on a second webpage. How to display each article on a different page using their id, was something that I
          hadn't tried before so,
          I am quite excited about doing it.
          <br><br>
          The site displays many photos. There are background photos on the body and for each article. Handling manually
          the photos became quickly hard so, I started to use the ImageKit CDN for an easier image transformation and
          conversion. <br><br>
          I learned more about handlebars and the use of an image-CDN. The site is light, loads fast and the Lighthouse
          results are good.
          Overall, I am satisfied with the result.

        <summary>Revelation Football Club</summary>
        <p class="w3-left-align">This has been another interesting project, which is still in progress. <br> <br>
          A football club located in Ghana wanted a site to present themselves.
          Building the site, I had to take into account the lack of infrastructure or/and the slow internet connection
          in Ghana. The site needs to load and run fast. I use the W3.CSS framework, which is very light and, I will try
          to use as native Javascript as possible. <br>
          One concern is that I use pictures in a webp format. Safari browser doesn't have good support and, since I
          don't know which Safari version the users will be using, I might have a problem with that but, it's an easy
          fix.<br> <br>
          This is the first time that I am not working alone on a project. The client has an opinion about the state of
          the site and on the other side, I get pictures and guidelines from a designer, who works with them. <br>
          On this project, I had the chance to use a wireframe to show a basic structure for the site. I had read about
          it during my studies on Frond-End Development but
          I had never tried it before. I didn't use some computer program, I just made a pdf document. <br>
          This situation has taught me a lot about communication. <br>
          Overall, I am happy with the process and the progress of the site.</p>
