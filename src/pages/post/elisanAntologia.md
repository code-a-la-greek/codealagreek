I've created this site for Elisa Stenberg, a young writer who wanted a space to share her writings.
 
## Features:
- W3schools html template
- W3CSS
- Unsplash Api
- Handlebars.js
- gitgub pages
 
I built this website using a template from W3schools.com and I'm working with the
w3-css framework, which is lightweight and easy to use. <br>
There are plenty of images.  I'm using an asynchronous fetch request to unsplash, so the site pulls automatically a random image in the background. <br>
I use handlebars.js as a templating language. All the information of the posts (title, the text itself etc.) are written in a javascript object and then injected by handlebars in html. Finally the site is hosted in Github.
