## 2022 is coming to a close, so it's time to reflect on what happened ðŸ˜ƒ

It was February of 2020 when I started to study Web development due to layoffs at my working place, because of the coronavirus pandemic.
I quickly progressed through it and at the same time, I started to study Front-end Development as well.
As I was getting more confident with my knowledge and skills, I joined Netlify in the end of 2020 so I'd start to build projects and practise all those things that I was learning.   

## Builds
As a result I started to pour tons of hours not only in building new projects but also developing my own website/portfolio and adding the new projects there.
The changes from then till this day have been massive. *This year I made 194 builds and my own website alone had 149 builds.*
Even though I don't update my site(or any other project) a specific day in the week, apparently according with the data *Friday is the most popular day for deploys* 

## Frameworks
There are tons of frameworks out there and it seems that every day a new javascript framework or library appears. Even though learning React is part of my studies-curiculum, I haven't progressed that much yet. However I often use simplier frameworks/libraries such as *Astro, Bootstrap and Tailwind*

## @codealagreek
I realised that, when it comes to greek language, there's luck of Web-Development material or even if there are some videos, they are outdated or not about modern methods, tools etc.   
So couple of months ago I decided to start a YouTube channel, named *<ins><a href="https://youtube.com/@codealagreek" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Code a la greek</a></ins>*, where I'm talking about front-end development in greek language.
