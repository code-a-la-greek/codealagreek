Just Games is an indie start-up game company based in Helsinki, Finland. They had their website on Wix.com but they needed a custom-built website. (2021-present) 

## Features:
- Astro website-builder
- mobile navigation
- Image Modals
- flip-cards, displaying games and info 
- Github flow (repository, issues, other participants)
- Netlify .toml file setup

I was provided with a design, giving me a layout to start with, images, text and some instructions on fonts, font-sizes and what features they would like to have. I created a color palette of 5 colors based on their logo.

The project's repository was on Github with one more participant from the company with whom I was discussing and solving any issues or bugs during the development.

**During development:**

Since there were many pages sharing the same content, I used the Astro. <br> 
All the images were already optimized and in .webp format. I only resized them locally using Squoosh. <br> 
Last I created a .toml file so they won't have to set up their netlify build settings.
