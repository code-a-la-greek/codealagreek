This is a solution to the <ins>*[Huddle landing page with curved sections challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections-5ca5ecd01e82137ec91a50f2)</ins>*.

## Built with
- Nicepage website builder

## My process

This time I try to build this design, using the site builder from nicepage.
The application's ui is not hard to learn but it takes a while to get used to all the settings and blocks. 

I believe the final result is good enough although I found some limitations. For example using a svg image as a background image was quite buggy and difficult to work with.

On the other hand, I liked quite much that nicepage app can export the site in a folder with the html,css, javascript files. And it does that for free.
I was pleased to see that the html file was relatively nicely written and semantic elements were in use too. However, nicepage uses quite much javascript on the page, jquerry and custom.

I'm relatively pleased and I will try again to build another layout
