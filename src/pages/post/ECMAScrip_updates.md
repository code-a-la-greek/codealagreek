title: "Keeping Up With The Speed: A Look at Recent ECMAScript Updates"
---
ECMAScript, the foundation of Javascript, is constantly evolving. Each year brings a new
edition, brimming with features that enhance the capabilities and developer experience.  \
Let's dive into the latest updates and explore some of the most noteworthy additions.

## ECMAScript 2023 (ES14): Streamlining Array Manipulation

Released in June 2023, ECMAScript 2023 places a strong focus on improving array
manipulation. Here are some key features:

* Enhanced Array Methods: New methods like `.filter.from()` and `.map.entries()` allow
  modifying arrays while keeping the original intact. This promotes a cleaner and safer code.

## ECMAScript 2022 (ES13): Top-Level Await Takes Center Stage

ECMAScript 2022, released in June 2022, introduced a significant change for asynchronous
  code. The top-level `await` syntax allows using the await keyword outside of `async functions`, streamlining asynchronous operations at the top level of your code.

## ECMAScript 2021 (ES12): BigInts and Beyond

ECMAScript 2021, released in June 2021, brought some major additions:

* `BigInt`: This new primitive data type allows developers to work with arbitrarily large integers, crucial for applications dealing with big numbers.
