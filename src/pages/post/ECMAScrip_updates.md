Keeping Up With The Speed: A Look at Recent ECMAScript Updates
ECMAScript, the foundation of Javascript, is constantly evolving. Each year brings a new
edition, brimming with features that enhance the capabilities and developer experience. Let's
dive into the latest updates and explore some of the most noteworthy additions.
ECMAScript 2023 (ES14): Streamlining Array Manipulation
Released in June 2023, ECMAScript 2023 places a strong focus on improving array
manipulation. Here are some key features:
● Enhanced Array Methods: New methods like .filter.from() and .map.entries() allow
modifying arrays while keeping the original intact. This promotes cleaner and safer code.
● Private Class Fields: Classes can now have private fields, restricting access and promoting
better data encapsulation.
ECMAScript 2022 (ES13): Top-Level Await Takes Center Stage
ECMAScript 2022, released in June 2022, introduced a significant change for asynchronous
code. The top-level await syntax allows using the await keyword outside of async functions,
streamlining asynchronous operations at the top level of your code.
ECMAScript 2021 (ES12): BigInts and Beyond
ECMAScript 2021, released in June 2021, brought some major additions:
● BigInt: This new primitive data type allows developers to work with arbitrarily large integers,
crucial for applications dealing with big numbers.
● Nullish Coalescing Operator (??): This operator simplifies conditional checks for nullish
values (null and undefined).
