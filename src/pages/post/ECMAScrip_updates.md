title: "Keeping Up With The Speed: A Look at Recent ECMAScript Updates"
---
ECMAScript, the foundation of Javascript, is constantly evolving. Each year brings a new
edition, brimming with features that enhance the capabilities and developer experience.
Let's dive into the latest updates and explore some of the most noteworthy additions.

## ECMAScript 2024: The Next Generation Date API in 2024
Released in July 2024, the ECMAScript 2024 improves the way we work with dates in JavaScript.
The Temporal API introduces a new global object, designed to simplify date and time manipulations in JavaScript.
It is however a new API with limited support from the browsers.

## ECMAScript 2023: Streamlining Array Manipulation

Released in June 2023, ECMAScript 2023 places a strong focus on improving array
manipulation. 
- New methods like `array.findLast()` and `array.findLastIndex()` allow us to find the last item in an array in a simpler way.
- New methods like `array.toSorted()` and `array.toSpliced()` allow
  modifying arrays while keeping the original intact.
This promotes a cleaner and safer code.

## ECMAScript 2022: Top-Level Await Takes Center Stage

ECMAScript 2022, released in June 2022, introduced a significant change for asynchronous code. The top-level `await` syntax allows using the await keyword outside of `async functions`, streamlining asynchronous operations at the top level of your code.
