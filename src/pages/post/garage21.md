Garage21 - Iliopoulos is a car repair shop based in Kalamata, Greece. They had their website on website platform but they had a few issues with it. 

## Issues
- The webpage had a broken layout
- confusing color-scheme
- grammar/spelling mistakes
- missing information (address, opening hours etc.) 
- unnecessary javascript files 
- unnecessary large webpage file 

## Development
I originally suggested fixing the page on the platform, since they had an account there and they were paying for it but
they had difficulties login into the service, so I had to start from scratch.
I made a single page with just html/css. I kept the idea of their original layout, but I moved the site to a dark-theme. I corrected the mistakes and I added all the missing information, including the policies for privacy, gdpr etc. All the images were optimized and converted to webp. format.

Since the page is just a single file, without unnecessary javascript and stylesheets, it loads fast and the size is down to a minimum.
The site is hosted in Netlify and it doesn't cost them anything.  
The page has also a contact form managed automatically by Netlify.
