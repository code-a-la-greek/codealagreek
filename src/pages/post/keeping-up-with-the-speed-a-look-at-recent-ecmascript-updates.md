title: "Keeping Up With The Speed: A Look at Recent ECMAScript Updates"
---
ECMAScript, the foundation of Javascript, is constantly evolving. Each year brings a new edition, brimming with features that enhance the capabilities and developer experience. Let's dive into the latest updates and explore some of the most noteworthy additions.

### ECMAScript 2023 (ES14): Streamlining Array Manipulation

Released in June 2023, ECMAScript 2023 places a strong focus on improving array manipulation. 

* Enhanced Array Methods: New methods like `.filter.from()` and `.map.entries()` allow modifying arrays while keeping the original intact. This promotes a cleaner and safer code.

### ECMAScript 2022 (ES13): Top-Level Await Takes Center Stage

ECMAScript 2022, released in June 2022, introduced a significant change in asynchronous code. The top-level `await`syntax allows using the await keyword outside of `async functions`, streamlining asynchronous operations at the top level of your code.

### ECMAScript 2021 (ES12): BigInts

ECMAScript 2021, released in June 2021:

* `BigInt`: This new primitive data type allows developers to work with arbitrarily large integers, crucial for applications dealing with big numbers.

The world of Javascript moves fast. Here are some resources to help you stay on top of ECMAScript updates:

* ECMAScript News: <https://ecmascript-daily.github.io/> delivers weekly updates on Javascript and tools.

By keeping yourself informed about the latest ECMAScript features, you can write cleaner, more efficient, and future-proof Javascript code. 

Happy coding!
