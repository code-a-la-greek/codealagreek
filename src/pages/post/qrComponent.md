This is a solution to the *<ins>[QR code component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H)</ins>*
challenge on Frontend Mentor.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind Css - CDN

## Process
This is my first try at solving a challenge with Tailwind Css. Since I am new to Tailwind Css, I thought to start with the simplest way, using tailwind from the cdn. As I learn more about Tailwind Css, I will try to use the other installation methods as well.
