This is a solution to the <ins>*[Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9)</ins>*.

## Built with
- Nicepage website builder

## My process

I try once again to build this design, using the site builder from nicepage.

Working with the nicepage website builder is relatively easy. However the layout is not automatically responsive 
and as a result I have to inspect and change it manually in every available breakpoint. A process very tedious.active

This is the last layout I try with Nicepage.
