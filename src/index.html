                <p class="pt-1 mb-0"> I identified several areas which I could improve: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The site was made with Bootstrap 3</li>
                  <li>It didn't pass the lighthouse tests</li>
                  <li>It scored poorly on security tests</li>
                  <li>It didn't comply with the GDPR policy</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="card-text">I built a new website from scratch. I still used their brand colors and most of the
                  text they had. For design, I used the new version of Bootstrap 5.1. <br>
                  I optimized all of their videos and images, serving .webp images. <br>
                  No cookies are used, but there is a contact form therefore a privacy policy is required. I had never before implemented a
                  privacy policy and it was quite a challenge to find information. Luckily I stumped upon
                  <em>iubenda.com</em> who offer services for privacy-policies, terms of use, cookies etc. <br>
                  I increased the security of the site, setting some headers, such as referer-policy,
                  content-security-policy, x-frame options etc. That was a challenge as well but there's good
                  documentation at <em>mozilla.org</em>. <br>
                  Finally the site is bundled with Snowpack and served in Netlify.

        <summary>Elisan Antologia</summary>
        <p>
          <em>Elisan Antologia</em> is a blog for Elisa Stenberg, a young
          writer from Finland. She needed a blog to share her writings. Since
          the project wasn't that demanding, I suggested creating a one-page
          site styled with W3.CSS to display her documents. <br /><br />
          On second thought, however, I made two separate pages since one page
          would have been too long to read if all of her documents were on the
          same page. <br /><br />
          I worked a lot with handlebars.js in this project and I loved it. I
          used handlebars to display each of her documents on a second
          webpage. How to display each article on a different page using their
          id, was something that I hadn't tried before so, I am quite excited
          about doing it.
          <br /><br />
          The site displays many photos. There are background photos on the
          body and for each article. Handling manually the photos became
          quickly hard so, I started to use the ImageKit CDN for an easier
          image transformation and conversion. <br /><br />
          I learned more about handlebars and the use of an image-CDN. The
          site is light, loads fast and the Lighthouse results are good.
          Overall, I am satisfied with the result.

        <summary>Revelation Football Club</summary>
        <p>
          This has been another interesting project, which is still in
          progress. <br />
          <br />
          A football club located in Ghana wanted a site to present
          themselves. Building the site, I had to take into account the lack
          of infrastructure or/and the slow internet connection in Ghana. The
          site needs to load and run fast. I use the W3.CSS framework, which
          is very light and, I will try to use as native Javascript as
          possible. <br />
          One concern is that I use pictures in a webp format. Safari browser
          doesn't have good support and, since I don't know which Safari
          version the users will be using, I might have a problem with that
          but, it's an easy fix.<br />
          <br />
          This is the first time that I am not working alone on a project. The
          client has an opinion about the state of the site and on the other
          side, I get pictures and guidelines from a designer, who works with
          them. <br />
          On this project, I had the chance to use a wireframe to show a basic
          structure for the site. I had read about it during my studies on
          Frond-End Development but I had never tried it before. I didn't use
          some computer program, I just made a pdf document.
          <br />
          This situation has taught me a lot about communication. <br />
          Overall, I am happy with the process and the progress of the site.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Panagiotis and I'm currently working in the automobile industry. In April 2020, I joined Codecademy and
        started studying Web-Development. I enjoy the frontend development. I like to build websites and
        web-applications. </p>

      <p> I've also joined Frontend Mentor, a
        site where
        I can complete frontend challenges.
        All the projects in my portfolio are either based on exercises
        during my studies in Codecademy or completed challenges from
        Frontend Mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Up until today, my experience in coding comes from working on
        projects, from Codecademy and Front-end mentor. I have also worked on
        other people's projects, which has given me valuable experience. You
        can read more about these projects below.
