                    I identified several areas which I could improve:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The site was made with Bootstrap 3</li>
                    <li>It didn't pass the lighthouse tests</li>
                    <li>It scored poorly on security tests</li>
                    <li>It didn't comply with the GDPR policy</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    I built a new website from scratch. I still used their brand
                    colors and most of the text they had. For design, I used the
                    new version of Bootstrap 5. <br />
                    I optimized all of their videos and images, serving .webp
                    images. <br />
                    No cookies are used, but due to a contact form a privacy
                    policy is required. I created one with
                    <em>iubenda.com</em> who offers services as
                    privacy-policies, terms of use, cookies etc. and I also
                    added the privacy and GDPR policy that Netlify provides.
                    <br />
                    I increased the security of the site, setting some headers,
                    such as referer-policy, content-security-policy, x-frame
                    options etc. That was a challenge as well but there's good
                    documentation at <em>mozilla.org</em>. <br />
                    The site is hosted in Netlify.

                    I built a new website from scratch. I chose to work with the
                    PaperCss framework because it is very minimal, customizable
                    with my own css, it looks funny and fresh. <br />
                    As the blog grows there will be plenty of images, therefore
                    I use an image-CDN to automatically optimize, transform the
                    images in real-time, and storage them as well. <br />
                    I use handlebars.js as a templating language. All the
                    information of the posts (destination, description, images)
                    are written in a javascript object and then injected by
                    handlebars in html. <br />
                    Finally the site is bundled with Snowpack and hosted in
                    Netlify.

                  <p class="pt-2">
                    I built this website using a template from
                    <em>W3schools.com</em> and I'm working with the W3Css
                    framework. w3.css is lightweight and easy to use. <br />
                    There are plenty of images, therefore I use an image-CDN to
                    automatically optimize, transform the images in real-time,
                    and storage them as well. <br />
                    I use handlebars.js as a templating language. All the
                    information of the posts (title, the text itself etc.) are
                    written in a javascript object and then injected by
                    handlebars in html. <br />
                    Finally the site is hosted in Github.

            Hello! I'm Panagiotis and I'm currently working in the automobile
            industry. In April 2020, I joined Codecademy and started studying
            Web-Development. I enjoy the frontend development very much.

            frontend challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up until today, my experience in coding comes from working on
            projects, from Codecademy and Front-end mentor. Participating in
            other people's projects has also given me valuable experience.

        <p>
          This has been another interesting project, which is still in
          progress. <br />
          <br />
          A football club located in Ghana wanted a site to present
          themselves. Building the site, I had to take into account the lack
          of infrastructure or/and the slow internet connection in Ghana. The
          site needs to load and run fast. I use the W3.CSS framework, which
          is very light and, I will try to use as native Javascript as
          possible. <br />
          One concern is that I use pictures in a webp format. Safari browser
          doesn't have good support and, since I don't know which Safari
          version the users will be using, I might have a problem with that
          but, it's an easy fix.<br />
          <br />
          This is the first time that I am not working alone on a project. The
          client has an opinion about the state of the site and on the other
          side, I get pictures and guidelines from a designer, who works with
          them. <br />
          On this project, I had the chance to use a wireframe to show a basic
          structure for the site. I had read about it during my studies on
          Frond-End Development but I had never tried it before. I didn't use
          some computer program, I just made a pdf document.
          <br />
          This situation has taught me a lot about communication. <br />
          Overall, I am happy with the process and the progress of the site.
